Website Link: **[linepunish.github.io](https://linepunish.github.io/)**

Have you ever had to write lines as punishment?
This website is a simple line typing punishment tool.
It simulates a traditional punishment given to students.
You have to enter a sentence, enter the number of times you need to type it, and then type that sentence repeatedly for the required number of times.

INSTRUCTIONS

1: Enter the sentence, which needs to be typed several times, in the first box and click the OK button.

2: Enter the number of times you want to type it in the second box and click the OK button.

3: Type that sentence the number of times you have specified and press the Enter key or click the Enter button. After you complete the task, the website will display the exact number of times you have typed the sentence.

We have made the website to help correct your young ones, yourself, or persons in your care.
You can use any device to use this website: laptops, smartphones, even e-readers, you name it!
